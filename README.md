Template for filtering system in Certified Consultant Page

[Staging Environment](https://achcdev.wpenginepowered.com/certified-consultants/) - Design for ACHC Certified Consultant page. This page uses a few plugins to make this work. [Advanced Custom Field](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), [Custom Post Types UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/), and the <span style="">Paid Version</span> [Filter Everthing](https://wordpress.org/plugins/filter-everything/) plugin. 

## How does Filter Everything Plugin work? 

Filter Everything (FE) uses Advanced Custom Field (ACF) to tie in filterization. Connecting ACF to Custom Post Types UI (CPTUI) creates metadata that FE uses to be able to filter that data in the front end. You can then add filter metadata inside FE.
